SNAP is the common software platform for the three Sentinel Toolboxes which are developed 
by the [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://www.esa.int) for the scientific exploitation 
of the [Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 missions](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/home).

The project page of SNAP and the sentinel toolboxes can be found at http://step.esa.int. There you will find a tutorial about the usage of the application, a [forum](http://forum.step.esa.int/) where you can ask questions and lots of other interesting things.

The intention of the development is to primarily support the Sentinel missions for not
only research but also in an operational context. In addition, a great deal of the
development will be to improve and produce a common application platform for all
toolboxes for the next 10 years.

The Toolboxes are be based on the proven BEAM/NEST architecture inheriting
all BEAM and NEST functionality including multi-mission support for
SAR and optical missions and provide an evolutionary update to the architecture
to support ESA and third party missions for years to come.
In practical terms this means that all three toolboxes are based on the extension
of the existing open source BEAM and NEST toolbox framework. The common
platform is jointly developed by SkyWatch, CS-FR, CS-RO and Brockmann Consult.

### Building toolboxes from the source

How SNAP and the toolboxes can be built from source is documented in our [Developer Guide](https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SNAP/Developer+Guide).
