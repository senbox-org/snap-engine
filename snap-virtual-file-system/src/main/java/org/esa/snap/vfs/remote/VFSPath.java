/**
 * Path for VFS.
 * An object that may be used to locate a file in a file system. It will typically represent a system dependent file path.
 *
 * <p> A {@code Path} represents a path that is hierarchical and composed of a sequence of directory and file name elements separated by a special separator or delimiter. A <em>root component</em>, that identifies a file system hierarchy, may also be present. The name element that is <em>farthest</em> from the root of the directory hierarchy is the name of a file or directory.
 * The other name elements are directory names. A {@code Path} can represent a root, a root and a sequence of names, or simply one or more name elements.
 * A {@code Path} is considered to be an <i>empty path</i> if it consists solely of one name element that is empty. Accessing a file using an
 * <i>empty path</i> is equivalent to accessing the default directory of the file system. {@code Path} defines the {@link #getFileName() getFileName},
 * {@link #getParent getParent}, {@link #getRoot getRoot}, and {@link #subpath subpath} methods to access the path components or a subsequence of its name elements.
 *
 * <p> In addition to accessing the components of a path, a {@code Path} also defines the {@link #resolve(Path) resolve} and {@link #resolveSibling(Path) resolveSibling} methods to combine paths. The {@link #relativize relativize} method that can be used to construct a relative path between two paths.
 * Paths can be {@link #compareTo compared}, and tested against each other using the {@link #startsWith startsWith} and {@link #endsWith endsWith} methods.
 *
 * <p> This interface extends {@link Watchable} interface so that a directory located by a path can be {@link #register registered} with a {@link
 * WatchService} and entries in the directory watched. </p>
 *
 * <p> <b>WARNING:</b> This interface is only intended to be implemented by those developing custom file system implementations. Methods may be added to this interface in future releases. </p>
 * <p>
 * <h2>Accessing Files</h2>
 * <p> Paths may be used with the {@link Files} class to operate on files, directories, and other types of files. For example, suppose we want a {@link java.io.BufferedReader} to read text from a file "{@code access.log}". The file is located in a directory "{@code logs}" relative to the current working directory and is UTF-8 encoded.
 * <pre>
 *     Path path = FileSystems.getDefault().getPath("logs", "access.log");
 *     BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <a name="interop"></a><h2>Interoperability</h2>
 * <p> Paths associated with the default {@link java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider provider} are generally interoperable with the {@link java.io.File java.io.File} class. Paths created by other providers are unlikely to be interoperable with the abstract path names represented by {@code java.io.File}. The {@link java.io.File#toPath toPath} method may be used to obtain a {@code Path} from the abstract path name represented by a {@code java.io.File} object. The resulting {@code Path} can be used to operate on the same file as the {@code java.io.File} object. In addition, the {@link #toFile toFile} method is useful to construct a {@code
 * File} from the {@code String} representation of a {@code Path}.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Concurrency</h2>
 * <p> Implementations of this interface are immutable and safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
