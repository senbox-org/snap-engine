/**
 * File Channel for VFS.
 * A channel for reading, writing, mapping, and manipulating a file.
 *
 * <p> A file channel is a {@link SeekableByteChannel} that is connected toa file. It has a current <i>position</i> within its file which can be both {@link #position() <i>queried</i>} and {@link #position(long) <i>modified</i>}.  The file itself contains a variable-length sequence of bytes that can be read and written and whose current {@link #size <i>size</i>} can be queried.  The size of the file increases when bytes are written beyond its current size; the size of the file decreases when it is {@link #truncate <i>truncated</i>}.  The file may also have some associated <i>metadata</i> such as access permissions, content type, and last-modification time; this class does not define methods for metadata access. </p>

     *
     * <p> A region of a file may be mapped into memory in one of three modes: </p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li><p> <i>Read-only:</i> Any attempt to modify the resulting buffer will cause a {@link ReadOnlyBufferException} to be thrown. ({@link MapMode#READ_ONLY MapMode.READ_ONLY}) </p></li>
     *
     * <li><p> <i>Read/write:</i> Changes made to the resulting buffer will eventually be propagated to the file; they may or may not be made visible to other programs that have mapped the same file.  ({@link MapMode#READ_WRITE MapMode.READ_WRITE}) </p></li>
     *
     * <li><p> <i>Private:</i> Changes made to the resulting buffer will not be propagated to the file and will not be visible to other programs that have mapped the same file; instead, they will cause private copies of the modified portions of the buffer to be created.  ({@link MapMode#PRIVATE MapMode.PRIVATE}) </p></li>
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p> For a read-only mapping, this channel must have been opened for reading; for a read/write or private mapping, this channel must have been opened for both reading and writing.
     *
     * <p> The {@link MappedByteBuffer <i>mapped byte buffer</i>} returned by this method will have a position of zero and a limit and capacity of <tt>size</tt>; its mark will be undefined.  The buffer and the mapping that it represents will remain valid until the buffer itself is garbage-collected.
     *
     * <p> A mapping, once established, is not dependent upon the file channel that was used to create it.  Closing the channel, in particular, has no effect upon the validity of the mapping.
     *
     * <p> Many of the details of memory-mapped files are inherently dependent upon the underlying operating system and are therefore unspecified.  The behavior of this method when the requested region is not completely contained within this channel's file is unspecified.  Whether changes made to the content or size of the underlying file, by this program or another, are propagated to the buffer is unspecified.  The rate at which changes to the buffer are propagated to the file is unspecified.
     *
     * <p> For most operating systems, mapping a file into memory is more expensive than reading or writing a few tens of kilobytes of data via the usual {@link #read read} and {@link #write write} methods.  From the standpoint of performance it is generally only worth mapping relatively large files into memory.  </p>

     * @param position The position within the file at which the mapped region is to start; must be non-negative
