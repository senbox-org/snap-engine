 * File Store for VFS.

 * <p> Storage for files. A {@code FileStore} represents a storage pool, device, partition, volume, concrete file system or other implementation specific means of file storage. The {@code FileStore} for where a file is stored is obtained by invoking the {@link Files#getFileStore getFileStore} method, or all file stores can be enumerated by invoking the {@link FileSystem#getFileStores getFileStores} method.</p>
 *
 * <p> In addition to the methods defined by this class, a file store may support one or more {@link FileStoreAttributeView FileStoreAttributeView} classes that provide a read-only or updatable view of a set of file store attributes. </p>
