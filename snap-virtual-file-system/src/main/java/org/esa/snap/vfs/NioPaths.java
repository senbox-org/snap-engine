     * Converts a path string, or a sequence of strings that when joined form a path string, to a {@code Path}. If {@code more} does not specify any elements then the value of the {@code first} parameter is the path string to convert. If {@code more} specifies one or more elements then each non-empty string, including {@code first}, is considered to be a sequence of name elements (see {@link Path}) and is joined to form a path string.
     * The details as to how the Strings are joined is provider specific but typically they will be joined using the {@link FileSystem#getSeparator name-separator} as the separator. For example, if the name separator is
     * "{@code /}" and {@code getPath("/foo","bar","gus")} is invoked, then the path string {@code "/foo/bar/gus"} is converted to a {@code Path}.
     * A {@code Path} representing an empty path is returned if {@code first} is the empty string and {@code more} does not contain any non-empty strings.
     *
     * <p> The {@code Path} is obtained by invoking the {@link FileSystem#getPath getPath} method of the {@link FileSystems#getDefault default} {@link
     * FileSystem}.
     *
     * <p> Note that while this method is very convenient, using it will imply an assumed reference to the default {@code FileSystem} and limit the utility of the calling code. Hence it should not be used in library code intended for flexible reuse. A more flexible alternative is to use an existing {@code Path} instance as an anchor, such as:
     * <pre>
     *     Path dir = ...
     *     Path path = dir.resolve("file");
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param first the path string or initial part of the path string
     * @param more  additional strings to be joined to form the path string
     * @return the resulting {@code Path}
     * @throws InvalidPathException if the path string cannot be converted to a {@code Path}
     * @see FileSystem#getPath

     * Converts the given URI to a {@link Path} object.

     * <p> This method iterates over the {@link java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider#installedProviders() installed} providers to locate the provider that is identified by the
     * URI {@link java.net.URI#getScheme scheme} of the given URI. URI schemes are compared without regard to case. If the provider is found then its {@link
     * java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider#getPath getPath} method is invoked to convert the
     * URI.
     *
     * <p> In the case of the default provider, identified by the URI scheme
     * "file", the given URI has a non-empty path component, and undefined query and fragment components. Whether the authority component may be present is platform specific. The returned {@code Path} is associated with the
     * {@link FileSystems#getDefault default} file system.
     *
     * <p> The default provider provides a similar <em>round-trip</em> guarantee to the {@link java.io.File} class. For a given {@code Path} <i>p</i> it is guaranteed that

     * <i>p</i><tt>.{@link Path#toAbsolutePath() toAbsolutePath}())</tt>
     * </blockquote> so long as the original {@code Path}, the {@code URI}, and the new {@code
     * Path} are all created in (possibly different invocations of) the same
     * Java virtual machine. Whether other providers make any guarantees is provider specific and therefore unspecified.
     *
     * @param uri the URI to convert
     * @return the resulting {@code Path}
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException                  if preconditions on the {@code uri} parameter do not hold. The format of the URI is provider specific.
     * @throws java.nio.file.FileSystemNotFoundException The file system, identified by the URI, does not exist and cannot be created automatically, or the provider identified by the URI's scheme component is not installed
     * @throws SecurityException                         if a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified permission to access the file system
