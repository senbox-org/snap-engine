    <h3>Export products using the GDAL library</h3>

    <p>This command allows to save products into several formats. The format used to save the product corresponds 
	   to the file type selected in the save dialog window.
    </p>
    <p>Images data products are delivered in several image formats, as shown in the table:

            <td>KEA is an image file format, named after the New Zealand bird, that provides a full implementation of 
			the GDAL data model and is implemented within a HDF5 file. A software library, likea, is used to access the 
			file format. The format has comparable performance with existing formats while producing smaller file sizes 
			and is already within active use for a number of projects within Landcare Research, New Zealand, 
			and the wider community.</td>

			Compressed and missing tiles in Erdas files should be handled properly on read. Files between 2GiB and 4GiB in size 
			should work on Windows NT, and may work on some Unix platforms. Files with external spill files (needed for datasets 
			larger than 2GiB) are also support for reading and writing.</td>

    <p>
        The supported GDAL library versions are listed <a href="nbdocs://org.esa.snap.snap.help/org/esa/snap/snap/help/docs/desktop/OptionsDialog.html#GDALLibraryLoaderConfig">here</a>. If this library is already installed, then it is used; otherwise the application will use the internal distribution (3.2.1).
        This functionality is available on machines with the Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OSX operating system.
