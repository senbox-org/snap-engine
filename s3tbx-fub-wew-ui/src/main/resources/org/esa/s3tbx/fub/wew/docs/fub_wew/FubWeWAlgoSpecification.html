<h3>Algorithm Specification</h3>

<p>
    The FUB/WeW Water Processor makes use of MERIS Level-1b TOA radiances in the
    bands 1-7, 9-10 and 12-14 to retrieve the following case II water properties and
    atmospheric properties above case II waters :
</p>

<ul>
    <li>chlorophyll-a concentration (log scale, mg/m^3)</li>
    <li>yellow substance absorption @ 443 nm (log scale, 1/m)</li>
    <li>total suspended matter concentration (log scale, g/m^3)</li>
    <li>yellow substance absorption @ 443 nm (log scale, 1/m)</li>
    <li>aerosol optical depth @ 440 nm</li>
    <li>aerosol optical depth @ 550 nm</li>
    <li>aerosol optical depth @ 670 nm</li>
    <li>aerosol optical depth @ 870 nm</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 412 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 442 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 490 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 510 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 560 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 620 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 665 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 708 nm (1/sr)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The retrieval is based on four separate artificial neural networks which
were trained on the basis of the results of extensive radiative transfer
simulations with the MOMO code by taking varying atmospheric and oceanic
conditions into account. All networks were validated against in-situ
measurements.
</p>

<p>
During the Plugin processing the MERIS Level-1b data are masked prior to
the retrieval by applying the following combination mask :
</p>

<ul>
    <li>GLINT_RISK</li>
    <li>BRIGHT</li>
    <li>INVALID</li>
    <li>SUSPECT (only when not masking out almost all pixels)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The masked pixel's values are set to 5.
</p>

<p>
Non-masked pixels are then normalized for an atmosphere's ozone contents of
344 Dobson units by calculating transmission correction factors.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the AOT wavelengths 440, 670 and 870 nm correspond to the
AERONET data wavelengths for a convenient direct comparison with in situ data.
</p>

<p>
Each pixel is checked against the input and output values margin of the
trained networks. Additional flags are set in case of a neural network
failure for input and output separately.
</p>

<p>
The radiative transfer simulation code and the retrieval algorithm are
described in detail in the papers cited in the references section below.
We would like to stress the fact that the operator is applicable over
case II only, thus it is likely to fail over the open ocean by producing
negative remote sensing (RS) water-leaving reflectances.
