<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    The Idepix Processor provides a pixel classification into properties such as clear/cloudy, land/water, snow, ice etc.
    The processing options/parameters as well as the underlying classification algorithms are instrument-dependent.
    The Idepix processor provided with the current SNAP version supports MODIS and Landsat-8.
    Idepix is continuously being improved and extended for further instruments in the frame of various projects, such as
    the ESA LandCover ([1],[2]) and OceanColour ([3]) CCI projects.
