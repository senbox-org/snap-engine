<h3>Algorithm Specification</h3>

<h4>Neural network classification</h4>

<p>
    The Idepix classification algorithm for Landsat-8 is primarily based on a neural network approach [1].
    Depending on the given scene, the user can select different neural nets for the processing, i.e. if the
    scene mainly consists of land or water pixels.

    As input, all spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared range are used: A few nets also
    use the thermal infrared spectral bands. The following neural nets are available:

<ul>
    <li>"ALL": a standard neural net applicable for most conditions</li>
    <li>"LAND": a neural net for use preferrably over land</li>
    <li>"LAND_USE_THERMAL": a neural net for use preferrably over land, uses also thermal infrared bands as input</li>
    <li>"WATER": a neural net for use preferrably over water</li>
    <li>"WATER_NOTIDAL": a neural net for use preferrably over nontidal water</li>
    <li>"WATER_USE_THERMAL": a neural net for use preferrably over water, uses also thermal infrared bands as input</li>
    <li>"WATER_NOTIDAL_USE_THERMAL": a neural net for use preferrably over notidal water, uses also thermal infrared
        bands
        as input
    </li>
</ul>

As output, the neural net finally provides per pixel one of the properties 'clear sky', 'cloud sure',
'cloud ambiguous' or 'snow/ice'.

<h4>Additional cloud tests</h4>

The classification algorithm for Landsat-8 provides a couple of further cloud tests which can be applied optionally.
These are:

<ul>
    <li>the "SHIMEZ" test</li>
    <li>the "HOT" test</li>
    <li>the "CLOST" test</li>
    <li>the "OTSU" test</li>
</ul>

<h5>The SHIMEZ cloud test</h5>
<p>
    The basic ideas behind the SHIMEZ cloud test are described in more detail in [2]. Finally, a cloud indicator
    from this test is derived as follows:
</p>
<p>
    The three spectral bands at 480nm, 560nm and 655nm are considered. A blue/green ratio is defined as
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/formulaRatioBlueGreen.png"></p>
<p>
    and a red/green ratio as
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/formulaRatioRedGreen.png"></p>
<p>
    and finally a red/green/blue mean value as
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/formulaMean.png"></p>
<p>
    The SHIMEZ cloud indicator is then given by the boolean exppression
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/formulaShimez.png"></p>
<p>
    where A and B are user options for fine-tuning.
</p>

<h5>The HOT cloud test</h5>
<p>
    The basic ideas behind the HOT cloud test are also described in more detail in [2]. A cloud indicator
    from this test is simply given as:
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/formulaHot.png"></p>
<p>
    where A is another user option for fine-tuning.
</p>

<h5>The CLOST cloud test</h5>
<p>
    The CLOST cloud test has been provided by [3]. A cloud indicator from this test is given as:
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/formulaClost.png"></p>
<p>
    where A is another user option for fine-tuning.
</p>

<h5>The OTSU cloud test</h5>
<p>
    The basic ideas behind the OTSU cloud test are described in more detail in [4]. A cloud indicator
    from this test is simply given as:
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/formulaOtsu.png"></p>
<p>
    where <b>br</b> is a 'brightness' value on a grey-scale interval [0, 255].
</p>

<h5>Final cloud flag</h5>
<p>
    A pixel is finally classified as 'cloud sure' if the neural network test indicates the pixel as 'cloud sure'
    and one of the applied additional tests (SHIMEZ, HOT, CLOST, OTSU) indicates the pixel as cloudy.
    A pixel is finally classified as 'cloud ambiguous' if the neural network test indicates
    the pixel as 'cloud ambiguous'. The additional tests are not considered here.
</p>


<h4>Brightness and whiteness</h4>

<p>
    A bright spectrum means that the intensity of the spectral curve (related to the albedo) should present relatively
    high values. Therefore, cloud brightness is calculated for each pixel as the integral of spectrum, and differs from
    the average of the spectral channels since it takes into account the distribution of the energy along the spectrum.
</p>
<p>
    A white spectrum means that the spectral signature must be flat along the spectrum. The first derivative of the
    spectral curve should present low values, but noise and calibration errors may reduce the accuracy in the estimation
    of the spectrum flatness when computing the spectral derivative in channels with similar wavelengths.
</p>

<p>
    In another classification step, , the spectral bands at 480nm, 655nm and 865nm are used to compute the 'whiteness' and
    the 'brightness', and to provide corresponding 'white' and a 'bright' flags:

<p align="center"><img src="images/formulaBrightWater.png"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/formulaWhite.png"></p>


<h4>Additional properties</h4>
<p>
    The following additional pixel properties are provided from the classification:
<ul>
    <li>
        'cloud_buffer': The pixel is located in a 'safety buffer' around an area classified as cloud. The width of
        the buffer is given in pixels.
    </li>
    <li>
        'land': the pixel is located over land
    </li>
    <li>
        'coastline': the pixel is a coastline pixel
    </li>
</ul>

The 'land' and 'coastline' pixels are identified from an SRTM land/water mask [5].

<h4>Final classification flags</h4>
<p>
    From the algorithm steps outlined above, the following final classification flags are provided for Landsat-8:
<ul>
    <li>
        'INVALID' (input invalid or no classification possible)
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_SURE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD' (equal to CLOUD_SURE here)
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_BUFFER'
    </li>
    <li>
        'SNOW_ICE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'COASTLINE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'LAND'
    </li>
    <li>
        'BRIGHT'
    </li>
    <li>
        'WHITE'
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Known issues</h4>
<p>
    Due to the large number of pixels in Landsat-8 products and the variety of classification tests,
    the pixel classification is usually rather time-consuming.
</p>
<p>
    The following pixel properties are currently NOT provided for Landsat-8:
<ul>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_SHADOW'
    </li>
    <li>
        'MIXED_PIXEL'
    </li>
    <li>
        'GLINT_RISK'
    </li>
</ul>
