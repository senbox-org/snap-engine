<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    <strong>Cluster analysis</strong> (or <strong>clustering</strong>) is the classification of objects into different
    groups, or more precisely, the partitioning of a data set into subsets (<strong>clusters</strong> or
    <strong>classes</strong>), so that the data in each subset
    (ideally) share some common trait - often proximity according to some defined distance measure. Data clustering is a
    common
    technique for statistical data analysis, which is used in many fields, including machine learning, data mining,
    pattern recognition, image analysis and bioinformatics. The computational task of classifying the data set into
    <em>k</em> clusters is often referred to as <em>k</em>-clustering.
</p>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<p>
    The k-means clustering tool implemented in SNAP is capable of working with arbitrary large scenes. Given the number
    of clusters <em>k</em>, the basic algorithm implemented in SNAP is:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Randomly choose <em>k</em> pixels whose samples define the initial cluster centers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assign each pixel to the nearest cluster center as defined by the Euclidean distance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Recalculate the cluster centers as the arithmetic means of all samples from all pixels in a cluster.
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the convergence criterion is met.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The convergence criterion is met when the maximum number of iterations specified by the user is
    exceeded or when the cluster centers did not change between two iterations. This algorithm should be your primary
    choice for performing a cluster analysis. <em>For the analysis of large scenes, this algorithm is strongly
    recommended.</em>
</p>

<p>
    The result of the cluster analysis is written to a band named <strong>class_indices</strong>. The
    values in this band indicate the class indices, where a value '0' refers to the first
    cluster, a value of '1' refers to the second cluster, etc. The class indices are sorted according
    to the number of members in the corresponding cluster, i.e. a class index of '0' refers to the
    cluster with the most members.
</p>

<p>
    Note that an index coding is attached to the <strong>class_indices</strong> band, which can be edited
    in the <a href="nbdocs://org.esa.snap.snap.help/org/esa/snap/snap/help/docs/desktop/ColorManipulationWindow.html#editingIndexCodedBands">Color Manipulation Window</a>.
    It is possible to change the label and the color associated with a class index. The last columns of the
    color manipulation window lists the location of the cluster centers. The cluster centers are also listed
    in the <strong>Cluster-Analysis</strong> group of the product metadata.

<h3>User Interface</h3>

<p>
    The k-means (KM) cluster analysis tool can be invoked from the Sentinel Toolbox tool menu by selecting
    the <b>K-Means Cluster Analysis</b> command in the <b>Image Analysis</b> submenu. In the command line it is
    available by means of the Graph Processing Tool <code>gpt</code> which is located in the Sentinel Toolbox
    <code>bin</code> directory. Please type <code>gpt KMeansClusterAnalysis -h</code> for further information.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the <b>K-Means Cluster Analysis</b> command from the Sentinel Toolbox tool menu pops up the
    following dialog:
</p>

    <img src="images/kmeans-io-parameters.PNG" alt="K-Means Cluster Analysis Dialog"/>
</p>

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Here the user specifies the name of the source product. The combo box presents
    a list of all products opened in the Sentinel Toolbox. The user may select one of these
    or, by clicking on the button next to the combo box, choose a product
    from the file system.
</p>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save as:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of file formats, currently BEAM-DIMAP, GeoTIFF, and HDF5.
    The text field allows to specify a target directory.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
    When the target product is not saved, it is opened in the Sentinel Toolbox automatically.
</p>

</p>

<h5>Processing Parameters Panel</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Number of clusters:</b>
    Use this field to specify the number of clusters. The default is 14 clusters.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Number of iterations:</b>
    Use this field to specify the maximum number of iterations to be carried out. The default is 30 iterations.
    The cluster analysis stops when the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Random seed:</b>
    The KM algorithm starts with a pseudo-random distribution of initial clusters. The random seed initializes
    the pseudo-random number generator, which is used to generate the initial clusters. By changing the random
    seed, you can start with different initial clusters. Any positive integral number will be a perfect random
    seed. The default seed is 31415.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Source band names:</b>
    Use this field to specify the names of the source bands. Press the control key while selecting or deselecting
    individual bands.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>ROI-Mask:</b>
    Use this field to restrict the cluster analysis to a region-of-interest (ROI). The combo box allows to select the
    band which provides the ROI.
</p>

<h5>Button Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Run</b>
    Creates the target product. The cluster analysis is actually deferred until its band data are accessed, either by
    writing the product to a file or by viewing its band data. When the <b>Save as</b> option is checked, the cluster
    analysis is triggered automatically.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Close</b>
    Closes the dialog.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Help</b>
    Displays this page in Sentinel Toolbox Help.
